# Neν-Lang

A New Language.

I call the language Neν because

- It is a new language, as both the last greek letter **ν** and the full name **Neν** (mimicing New) suggests.
- It does not intend to be a **huge** language which incorporates every modern and fancy feature;
  instead, it will be kept **simple** and **incomplete**. as the one **ν** cannot forms the complete word **Neνν**.
