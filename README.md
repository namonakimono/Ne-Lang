# Neν-Lang

A New Language.

I call the language Neν because

- It is a new language, as both the last greek letter **ν** and the full name Neν (mimicing New) suggests.
- It does not intend to be a **huge** language which incorporates every modern and fancy feature; instead, it will be kept simple but lacking features.
